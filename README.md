# SmartPhoneLockBox
the SmartPhoneLockBox is written in C language using Arduino software to compile and execute.

FUTURE WORKS: 
Within the lockbox.c file you would notice a "password" section at the top that is commented out. That is to be edited and functioning later on. The idea behind it is to have a code that can unlock the box if the user needs their device prior to the timer finshing. 

The electromagnetic lock does not have it's own independent power supply. However, it should for if the lockbox is unplugged, then the magnet will remain locked unless the password has been entered.
